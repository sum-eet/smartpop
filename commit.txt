Fix embedded app authentication CSP frame-ancestors error

AUTHENTICATION FIXES:
- Added explicit isEmbeddedApp: true to shopify.server.ts configuration
- Updated AppProvider with shopOrigin and forceRedirect props
- Fixed auth route to return authenticate.admin(request) directly
- Added session.shop to loader data for proper shop context

CSP FRAME-ANCESTORS ERROR FIX:
- Updated embedded app authentication to use proper new embedded auth strategy
- Added forceRedirect={true} to prevent iframe authentication attempts
- Configured shopOrigin prop to ensure proper shop context
- Fixed authentication flow to prevent X-Frame-Options conflicts

This should resolve the blank screen and CSP frame-ancestors error by ensuring
the authentication uses the proper embedded app flow instead of trying to load
Shopify's auth page in an iframe.
